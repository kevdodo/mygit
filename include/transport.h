/*
 * The git protocol is described at https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/gitprotocol-pack.txt
 * Fetching consists of several stages:
 * - The client opens an SSH connection to the server.
 *   Call open_transport(FETCH, ...) to initiate this SSH connection.
 * - The server sends a list of "refs" it knows about,
 *   i.e. branches and tags and their corresponding commit hashes.
 *   Call receive_refs() to handle each ref received from the server.
 * - The client chooses zero or more of these commit hashes that it wants to fetch.
 *   Call send_want() on each commit hash you want to receive.
 *   Call finish_wants() once the commit hashes have been sent.
 *   If no commit hashes were requested, STOP and call close_transport()!
 * - The client tells the server which commits hashes it already has,
 *   so the server can minimize the amount of data sent.
 *   There are different ways the server can decide the oldest commit it needs to send;
 *   we are using the basic strategy: the server chooses
 *   the first commit hash sent by the client that the server also has.
 *   This means that if you want to fetch the newest `master`, for example,
 *   the client should send the commit hash of `master` locally, then its parent,
 *   and so on, until it reaches a commit hash that the server also has.
 *   Call send_have() to send each local commit hash to the server.
 *   Call check_have_acks() periodically to check whether the server
 *   knows any of the commit hashes sent since the last check_have_acks().
 *   But don't call it after every commit hash, since it waits for the server to respond.
 *   Once the server returns that it is ready (or the client knows no more of its commits
 *   are common with the server), call finish_haves().
 * - The server figures out what needs to be sent to the client and sends a PACK file.
 *   This format is documented at https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/gitformat-pack.txt
 *   The file contains all the new objects (commits, trees, etc.) that the client needs.
 *   Call receive_pack() to handle each object received from the server.
 *
 * Pushing is a bit simpler since the client must already know the state of the remote:
 * - The client opens an SSH connection using open_transport(PUSH, ...)
 * - The server sends its current refs, just like at the start of a fetch.
 *   Call receive_refs() to receive these remote refs.
 *   If any ref that is going to be pushed points to a different commit on the remote
 *   than what the client thinks is on the remote, the push should be aborted.
 *   The client will need to run a fetch and merge in the remote's changes.
 * - The client sends a list of refs it wants the server to update.
 *   An update can create, delete, or change a branch.
 *   Call send_update() for each update and finish_updates() once all updates are sent.
 *   If no updates were requested, STOP and call close_transport()!
 * - The client sends all the new objects that the server needs in a PACK file.
 *   If no branches were requested to be created or changed, do not send a PACK file!
 *   Call start_pack() to send the header of the PACK file.
 *   Call send_pack_object() for each object (commit, tree, or blob) in the PACK file.
 *   Call finish_pack() once all objects have been sent.
 * - The server tells the client which updates were successful.
 *   Call check_updates() to receive each successfully updated ref.
